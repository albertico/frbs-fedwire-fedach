# E-Payments Routing Directory - Terms of Use

**Source:** https://www.frbservices.org/EPaymentsDirectory/agreement.html

By clicking "Agree", I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the [Federal Reserve Banks' terms of use](FRBS_TERMS.md) for the E-Payments Routing Directory. If I am entering into this agreement on behalf of my institution or any other person, I represent that I have the authority to do so. My institution or the other person will be bound, as I am, if I click "Agree." I understand that the terms of use prohibit selling, relicensing, or otherwise using information in the directory for commercial gain. I also understand that the Federal Reserve Banks provide the directory solely as a service to financial institutions to help them settle and process transactions efficiently.
